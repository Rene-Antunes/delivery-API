<h2 id="sobre" >Descrição do Projeto </h2>
With a strong specialization in Java and Spring Framework. Recently, I completed this highly complex project focused on a food delivery system. Using Java and Spring Boot, the application achieved the following:

Achievements:

- Applied SOLID principles and Clean Code practices to ensure clean and efficient code.
- Based the project architecture on Spring MVC, providing a robust and scalable structure.
- Documented the entire project with Swagger, facilitating integration and comprehension for other 
 developers.
- Encompassed the creation and management of users, cities, states, types of cuisines, and payment 
 methods.

This project not only showcases my skills in Java and Spring Boot but also my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-quality solutions.
